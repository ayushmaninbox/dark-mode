# Mode Switching Website

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 
Welcome to the Mode Switching Website. This project is a fun way to toggle between light and dark modes using a stylish custom switch button. It's built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to give you a smooth experience. The switch is right in the center of the screen, making it easy to use.

## What It Does

- **Switch Modes**: Flip between light and dark themes with a neat switch.
- **Keeps Your Choice**: Your mode preference is saved using `localStorage`, so you wonâ€™t lose it when you reload or revisit the page.
- **Responsive and Centered**: The switch button is centered and adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

Want to try it out on your own machine? Hereâ€™s how:

### Prerequisites

- Just a web browser is all you need. Chrome, Firefox, or Edge will do the trick.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal and run:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ayushmaninbox/dark-mode.git
    ```

2. **Go to the Project Folder**

    ```sh
    cd dark-mode
    ```

3. **Open It in Your Browser**

    Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to see it in action!

## How It Works

- **Switch It Up**: Click the switch to change between light and dark modes.
- **Preference Saved**: Your choice sticks around thanks to `localStorage`.

## Customization

Want to tweak things? Hereâ€™s how you can:

- **Move the Switch**: Adjust the `.mode-switcher` class in `styles.css` to reposition the switch button.
- **Change the Look**: Dive into `styles.css` to modify colors and styles to fit your taste.
